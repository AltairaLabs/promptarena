Understanding the differences between LLM providers and how to test effectively across them.

## Why Compare Providers?

Different LLM providers have unique characteristics that affect your application:

- **Response quality**: Accuracy and relevance vary
- **Response style**: Formal vs. conversational tone
- **Capabilities**: Function calling, vision, multimodal support
- **Performance**: Speed and latency
- **Cost**: Pricing per token varies significantly
- **Reliability**: Uptime and rate limits differ

Testing across providers helps you:
- Choose the best fit for your use case
- Build fallback strategies
- Optimize cost without sacrificing quality
- Stay provider-agnostic

      - type: content_includes
        params:
          patterns: ["key concepts"]
          message: "Should contain key concepts"
```

## Response Style Comparison

### Formatting Preferences

Different providers format responses differently:

```yaml
# Test query: "List 3 benefits of exercise"

# OpenAI tends toward:
"""
Here are 3 key benefits:
1. Improved cardiovascular health
2. Better mental well-being
3. Increased energy levels
"""

# Claude tends toward:
"""
Exercise offers numerous benefits. Let me highlight three important ones:

First, it significantly improves cardiovascular health by...
Second, it enhances mental well-being through...
Third, it boosts energy levels because...
"""

# Gemini tends toward:
"""
Here are 3 benefits:
* Cardiovascular health improvement
* Enhanced mental well-being  
* Increased energy
"""
```

**Test across styles:**
```yaml
assertions:
  # Provider-agnostic content check
  - type: content_includes
    params:
      patterns: ["cardiovascular", "mental", "energy"]
  
  # Not: format-specific assertion
  # - type: content_matches
  #   params:
  #     pattern: "^1\\. .+"  # Too OpenAI-specific
```

### Verbosity Differences

Response length varies significantly:

| Provider | Typical Length | Tendency |
|----------|---------------|----------|
| OpenAI | 50-150 words | Concise, to the point |
| Claude | 100-300 words | Detailed, explanatory |
| Gemini | 50-200 words | Direct, informative |

**Accommodate variation:**
```yaml
assertions:
  # Instead of exact length (use regex)
  - type: content_matches
    params:
      pattern: "^.{50,500}$"
      message: "Should be 50-500 characters"
  
  # Focus on content completeness
  - type: content_includes
    params:
      patterns: ["point1", "point2", "point3"]
      message: "Must cover all key points"
```

### Tone and Personality

Providers have distinct "personalities":

```yaml
# Same prompt: "Help me debug this error"

# OpenAI: Professional, structured
"""
To debug this error, follow these steps:
1. Check the error message
2. Review the stack trace
3. Verify your inputs
"""

# Claude: Empathetic, thorough
"""
I understand debugging can be frustrating. Let's work through 
this systematically. First, let's examine the error message 
to understand what's happening...
"""

# Gemini: Direct, solution-focused
"""
Error debugging steps:
- Check error message for root cause
- Verify inputs and configuration
- Review recent code changes
"""
```

**Test for appropriate tone:**
```yaml
assertions:
  # Not provider-specific phrases
  - type: llm_judge
    params:
      criteria: "Response is helpful and constructive"
      judge_provider: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
      message: "Must be helpful"
  
  # Not exact wording
  - type: llm_judge
    params:
      criteria: "Response is supportive and encouraging"
      judge_provider: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
      message: "Must be supportive"
```

## Performance Characteristics

### Response Time

Typical latencies (approximate):

```yaml
# Single-turn, 100 token response
openai-gpt4o-mini:     ~0.8-1.5 seconds
claude-haiku:          ~1.0-2.0 seconds
gemini-flash:          ~0.6-1.2 seconds

openai-gpt4o:          ~1.5-3.0 seconds
claude-sonnet:         ~1.5-2.5 seconds
gemini-pro:            ~1.0-2.0 seconds
```

**Note:** Arena does not provide a built-in response time assertion. Response latency can be observed in test output reports and tracked over time as a metric.

### Context Window Handling

Maximum context varies:

| Provider | Max Context | Best Use |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| GPT-4o | 128K tokens | General purpose |
| Claude Sonnet | 200K tokens | Long documents |
| Gemini Pro | 2M tokens | Massive context |

**Test long context:**
```yaml
apiVersion: promptkit.altairalabs.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Scenario
metadata:
  name: long-document-analysis

spec:
  task_type: test
  description: "Long Document Analysis"
  
    providers: [claude-sonnet, gemini-pro]  # Best for long context
    context:
      document: "${fixtures.50k_word_doc}"
    turns:
      - role: user
        content: "Summarize the key points"
        assertions:
          - type: llm_judge
            params:
              criteria: "Response accurately references and summarizes the provided document"
              judge_provider: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
              message: "Should reference document content"
```

## Cost Analysis

          - type: content_includes
            params:
              patterns: ["objects", "colors", "scene"]
```

## Testing Strategy by Provider

### Cross-Provider Baseline

Test all providers with same scenario:

```yaml
apiVersion: promptkit.altairalabs.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Scenario
metadata:
  name: standard-support-query

spec:
  task_type: test
  description: "Standard Support Query"
  
    providers: [openai-gpt4o-mini, claude-sonnet, gemini-flash]
    
    turns:
      - role: user
        content: "What's your refund policy?"
        assertions:
          # Common requirements for ALL providers
          - type: content_includes
            params:
              patterns: ["refund", "policy", "days"]
              message: "Must mention refund policy details"
          - type: llm_judge
            params:
              criteria: "Response is helpful and informative"
              judge_provider: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
              message: "Must be helpful"
```

### Provider-Specific Tests

Test unique capabilities:

```yaml
# OpenAI: Function calling
turns:
  - name: "Function Calling"
    providers: [openai-gpt4o]
    assertions:
      - type: tools_called
        params:
          tools: ["specific_function"]
          message: "Should call the specific function"

# Claude: Long context
turns:
  - name: "Long Document Processing"
    providers: [claude-sonnet]
    context:
      document: "${fixtures.100k_token_doc}"

# Gemini: Speed
turns:
  - name: "High Throughput"
    providers: [gemini-flash]
    assertions:
      - type: content_includes
        params:
          patterns: ["result"]
          message: "Should return a result"
```

### Fallback Testing

Test provider redundancy:

```yaml
apiVersion: promptkit.altairalabs.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Scenario
metadata:
  name: provider-failover

spec:
  task_type: test
  description: "Provider Failover"
  
    primary_provider: openai-gpt4o
    fallback_providers: [claude-sonnet, gemini-pro]
    
    scenarios:
      # Test primary
      - provider: openai-gpt4o
        expected_to_work: true
      
      # Test fallbacks
      - provider: claude-sonnet
        expected_to_work: true
      - provider: gemini-pro
        expected_to_work: true
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Provider-Agnostic Assertions

Write tests that work across providers:

```yaml
# ✅ Good: Works for all providers
assertions:
  - type: content_includes
    params:
      patterns: ["key", "terms"]
      message: "Must contain key terms"
  - type: llm_judge
    params:
      criteria: "Response is appropriate for the context"
      judge_provider: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
      message: "Must be appropriate"

# ❌ Avoid: Provider-specific expectations
assertions:
  - type: content_matches
    params:
      pattern: "^Here are 3"
      message: "Exact phrase - too OpenAI-specific"
```

### 2. Normalize for Comparison

Account for style differences:

```yaml
# Test content, not format
assertions:
  - type: llm_judge
    params:
      criteria: "Response covers the same key points as the expected content"
      judge_provider: "openai/gpt-4o-mini"
      message: "Should be similar to expected content"
```

### 3. Use Tags for Provider Categories

```yaml
apiVersion: promptkit.altairalabs.ai/v1alpha1
kind: Scenario
metadata:
  name: fast-provider-test

spec:
  task_type: test
  description: "Fast Provider Test"
  
    tags: [fast-providers]
    providers: [openai-mini, gemini-flash, claude-haiku]
  
  - name: "Premium Provider Test"
    tags: [premium-providers]
    providers: [openai-gpt4o, claude-sonnet, gemini-pro]
```

### 4. Cost-Aware Testing

```bash
# Development: Use cheap/mock
promptarena run --provider openai-mini

# CI: Use cost-effective
promptarena run --provider gemini-flash

# Pre-production: Use target provider
promptarena run --provider claude-sonnet
```

### 5. Benchmark Regularly

Track provider changes over time:

```yaml
# Monthly benchmark suite
benchmark:
  frequency: monthly
  providers: [openai-gpt4o, claude-sonnet, gemini-pro]
  scenarios: standard_benchmark_suite
  track:
    - pass_rate
    - average_response_time
    - cost_per_run
    - quality_scores
```

## When to Switch Providers

### Reasons to Use Multiple Providers

**During Development:**
- Test with cheap models (mini/flash)
- Validate with target model (final choice)
- Compare quality across options

**In Production:**
- Primary + fallback for reliability
- Route by use case (simple → mini, complex → premium)
- Cost optimization per scenario

### Decision Framework

```yaml
decision_matrix:
  use_openai_when:
    - need: function_calling
    - need: structured_output
    - priority: ease_of_use

  use_claude_when:
    - need: long_context
    - need: detailed_explanations
    - priority: quality

  use_gemini_when:
    - need: speed
    - need: cost_optimization
    - priority: throughput

  use_ollama_when:
    - need: zero_cost
    - need: data_privacy
    - need: offline_development
    - priority: local_iteration
```

## Conclusion

Provider choice affects:
- Response quality and style
