## Reporting a Vulnerability

We appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Create Public Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.** Public disclosure before a fix is available can put users at risk.

### 2. Report Privately

Send an email to our security team at: **[security@altairalabs.ai](mailto:security@altairalabs.ai)**

Include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact and attack scenarios
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations
- Your contact information for follow-up

### 3. Encryption (Optional)

For highly sensitive reports, you may encrypt your email using our PGP key:

```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP key will be provided upon request]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

### 4. Response Timeline

We are committed to responding to security reports promptly:

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving your report
- **Triage**: Within 5 business days we will provide an initial assessment
- **Updates**: Regular updates on our progress every 5-10 business days
- **Resolution**: Timeline depends on severity and complexity, typically within 30-90 days
