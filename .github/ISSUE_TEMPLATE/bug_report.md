## Documentation Impact

**Would closing this make something in the docs untrue?**
Check the docs for statements this issue would invalidate — a documented limitation,
a "not supported yet", or a described behaviour that changes. Docs deliberately carry
no issue links, so nothing points back here when this closes; the doc update has to be
part of the work.

- [ ] No documented statement changes
- [ ] Yes — the pages to update are listed below, and updating them is part of this issue

```
<paths under docs/ or examples/*/README.md that this makes stale>
```
