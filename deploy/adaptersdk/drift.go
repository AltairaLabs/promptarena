// A plan built from a stored state blob alone cannot see changes made outside
// promptarena: delete a resource in the cloud console and the adapter plans an
// UPDATE against something that is gone, which then fails at apply. Probing
// prior state against the live provider is what closes that gap.
//
// Three rules, and the third is the one worth sharing:
//
//   - confirmed absent  → drop, and report drift
//   - present, however degraded → keep; it exists, so it is an update
//   - lookup failed or unknown  → keep
//
// The last is easy to get backwards and expensive when wrong. Dropping a
// resource because the lookup errored plans a CREATE that collides with the
// live resource at apply time — turning a transient API error into a hard
// failure, or worse, a duplicate. Vertex makes this concrete: a malformed
// resource name returns InvalidArgument, not NotFound, so any "not found means
// absent" shortcut that treats every error alike deletes real state.
//
// A nil probe keeps everything: an adapter that cannot look up resources has
// no basis to drop them, and silently dropping would turn every plan into a
// full recreate.
