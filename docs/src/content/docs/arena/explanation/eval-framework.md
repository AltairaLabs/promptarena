Understanding PromptKit's automated evaluation system for LLM outputs.

## Overview

Evals are automated quality checks that run against LLM outputs. They answer questions like "Did the assistant stay on topic?", "Was the JSON valid?", or "Did it call the right tools?". Evals are defined in pack files and execute automatically during conversations or against recorded sessions.

Evals use the same [check types](https://promptkit.altairalabs.ai/reference/checks/) as assertions and guardrails. The difference is *when* and *where* they run: evals can fire in production on every turn, on a sampled subset, or at session close, whereas assertions only run during Arena tests and guardrails run inline before the response is delivered.

Eval handlers produce **scores only** (0.0–1.0). They never determine pass/fail — that responsibility belongs to assertion and guardrail wrappers. When used as standalone evals, the score is recorded as a metric and emitted as an event.

## Pack Evals vs Scenario Assertions

PromptKit offers two complementary evaluation mechanisms that share the same underlying [check types](https://promptkit.altairalabs.ai/reference/checks/):

| | Pack Evals | Scenario Assertions |
|---|---|---|
| **Defined in** | Pack file (`evals` array) | Arena scenario YAML |
| **Scope** | Any conversation using the pack | Specific test scenarios |
| **When** | Production + testing | Testing only |
| **Check types** | Any check from the [unified catalog](https://promptkit.altairalabs.ai/reference/checks/) | Any check from the [unified catalog](https://promptkit.altairalabs.ai/reference/checks/) |
| **Trigger** | Configurable (every turn, sampling, session close) | Every turn / conversation end |

**Pack evals** travel with your pack — they run in production, in Arena tests, and anywhere the pack is used. Think of them as built-in quality monitors.

**Scenario assertions** are Arena-specific test expectations. They validate specific conversation flows defined in your test scenarios.

Both can coexist: pack evals provide baseline quality monitoring while scenario assertions verify specific behaviors. See [Unified Check Model](https://promptkit.altairalabs.ai/concepts/validation/) for how evals, assertions, and guardrails relate.

## Eval Definition Structure

Each eval is an `EvalDef` object in the pack's `evals` array. The structure combines a check type with trigger, sampling, threshold, and metric configuration:

```json
{
  "id": "quality_check",
  "type": "contains",
  "trigger": "every_turn",
  "params": { "patterns": ["thank you"] },
  "threshold": { "min_score": 0.8 },
  "enabled": true,
  "sample_percentage": 10,
  "metric": {
    "name": "response_quality",
    "type": "gauge",
    "labels": { "category": "tone" }
  }
}
```

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `id` | Yes | Unique identifier for the eval within the pack |
| `type` | Yes | Check type from the [Checks Reference](https://promptkit.altairalabs.ai/reference/checks/) |
| `trigger` | Yes | When the eval fires (see [Triggers](#triggers)) |
| `params` | Varies | Parameters specific to the check type |
| `threshold` | No | Pass/fail threshold (e.g. `min_score`) |
| `enabled` | No | Whether the eval is active (default: `true`) |
| `sample_percentage` | No | Percentage of turns/sessions to evaluate (for sampling triggers) |
| `groups` | No | Eval groups for filtering (see [Eval Groups](#eval-groups)) |
| `metric` | No | Prometheus metric configuration (see [Metrics & Prometheus](#metrics--prometheus)) |

## Triggers

Each eval specifies when it should fire:

| Trigger | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `every_turn` | After each assistant response | Real-time quality checks |
| `on_session_complete` | When session closes | Summary evaluations |
| `sample_turns` | Percentage of turns (hash-based) | Production sampling |
| `sample_sessions` | Percentage of sessions (hash-based) | Production sampling |
| `on_conversation_complete` | When multi-session conversation closes | Final evaluation |
| `on_workflow_step` | After a workflow state transition | Workflow validation |

Sampling is **deterministic** — the same session ID and turn index always produce the same sampling decision (FNV-1a hash). This ensures reproducible behavior across runs.

```json
{
  "id": "toxicity_check",
  "type": "contains",
  "trigger": "sample_turns",
  "sample_percentage": 10,
  "params": {
    "patterns": ["harmful", "offensive"]
  }
}
```

## Eval Groups

Evals can belong to one or more groups, enabling selective execution. When no explicit groups are set, evals are automatically classified based on their handler type:

| Group | Value | Assigned To |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Default | `default` | All evals with no explicit groups |
| Fast-running | `fast-running` | Deterministic checks: `contains`, `regex`, `json_valid`, `tools_called`, workflow checks, etc. |
| Long-running | `long-running` | Compute/network-intensive: `llm_judge`, `cosine_similarity`, `outcome_equivalent`, `a2a_eval`, `rest_eval`, exec handlers |
| External | `external` | External system calls: `llm_judge`, `a2a_eval`, `rest_eval`, exec handlers |

### Automatic classification

Evals with no explicit `groups` field receive `default` plus one or more well-known groups. For example, a `contains` eval gets `["default", "fast-running"]`, while an `llm_judge` eval gets `["default", "long-running", "external"]`.

### Explicit groups

Setting `groups` on an eval definition overrides the automatic classification entirely:

```json
{
  "id": "compliance_check",
  "type": "llm_judge",
  "trigger": "every_turn",
  "groups": ["compliance", "safety"],
  "params": { "criteria": "Check regulatory compliance" }
}
```

This eval will only match when filtering for `compliance` or `safety` — it will no longer match `default`, `long-running`, or `external`.

### Filtering by group

In the SDK, use `EvalGroups` to select which groups to run:

```go
// Only run fast evals in the hot path
results, _ := sdk.Evaluate(ctx, sdk.EvaluateOpts{
    PackPath:   "./app.pack.json",
    Messages:   messages,
    EvalGroups: []string{"fast-running"},
})
```

When `EvalGroups` is nil or empty, all evals run regardless of group.

## Dispatch Patterns

The eval system supports three dispatch patterns for different deployment scenarios:

### Pattern A: InProcDispatcher

Runs evals synchronously in the same process. Used by Arena and simple SDK deployments.

```
Conversation ──► InProcDispatcher ──► EvalRunner ──► Handlers ──► ResultWriter
```

### Pattern B: EventDispatcher

Publishes eval requests to an event bus for async processing by workers. Used in production SDK deployments.

```
Conversation ──► EventDispatcher ──► Event Bus ──► EvalWorker ──► EvalRunner ──► ResultWriter
```

### Pattern C: EventBusEvalListener

Subscribes to EventBus `message.created` events and triggers evals automatically. No explicit middleware needed.

```
RecordingStage ──► EventBus ──► EventBusEvalListener ──► SessionAccumulator ──► Dispatcher ──► Runner
```

The `EventBusEvalListener` uses a `SessionAccumulator` that accumulates messages per session and builds `EvalContext` on demand. Sessions expire after a configurable TTL (default: 30 minutes).

## Eval Executor (Arena)

The `EvalConversationExecutor` evaluates **saved conversations** from recordings:

1. Load recording via adapter registry
2. Build conversation context from recorded messages
3. Apply turn-level assertions to each assistant message
4. Evaluate conversation-level assertions
5. Run pack session evals (if configured)
6. Return aggregated results

This enables offline evaluation of historical conversations without re-running them against a live LLM.

## Metrics & Prometheus

Eval results can be recorded as Prometheus metrics using the unified `metrics.Collector`. The same collector records both pipeline operational metrics and eval metrics into a standard `prometheus.Registry`.

```go
import (
    "github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus"
    "github.com/AltairaLabs/PromptKit/runtime/metrics"
    "github.com/AltairaLabs/PromptKit/sdk"
)

reg := prometheus.NewRegistry()
collector := metrics.NewCollector(metrics.CollectorOpts{
    Registerer:  reg,
    Namespace:   "myapp",
    ConstLabels: prometheus.Labels{"env": "prod"},
})

conv, _ := sdk.Open("./app.pack.json", "chat",
    sdk.WithMetrics(collector, nil),
)
```

When `WithMetrics()` is configured, all eval results are automatically recorded as Prometheus metrics alongside pipeline metrics. Evals with an explicit `metric` definition use that configuration; evals without one get an auto-generated gauge metric named after the eval ID. Eval metrics are namespaced under `{namespace}_eval_` to distinguish them from pipeline metrics. For example, a metric named `response_quality_score` with namespace `myapp` becomes `myapp_eval_response_quality_score`, and an eval with ID `check-tone` without an explicit metric becomes `myapp_eval_check-tone`. See [Metrics Reference](https://promptkit.altairalabs.ai/runtime/reference/metrics/) for the full catalog.

### Metric Types

| Type | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| `gauge` | Set to the eval's score value |
| `counter` | Increment count on each execution |
| `histogram` | Observe value with configurable buckets, track sum/count |
| `boolean` | 1.0 if score ≥ 1.0, 0.0 otherwise |

### Label Sources

**Pack-author labels** are declared in the `metric.labels` field of each eval definition:

```json
{
  "id": "response_quality",
  "type": "llm_judge",
  "trigger": "every_turn",
  "metric": {
    "name": "response_quality_score",
    "type": "histogram",
    "range": { "min": 0, "max": 1 },
    "labels": {
      "eval_type": "llm_judge",
      "category": "quality"
    }
  },
  "params": {
    "criteria": "Rate the quality of the response"
  }
}
```

**Const labels** are set via `CollectorOpts.ConstLabels` — process-level dimensions (env, region) baked into the metric descriptor.

**Instance labels** are set via `CollectorOpts.InstanceLabels` and bound per-conversation — conversation-level dimensions (tenant, prompt_name).

Label names must match Prometheus naming rules (`^[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*$`) and must not start with `__` (reserved by Prometheus). Invalid label names are caught during pack validation.

## Events

Eval results emit events through the EventBus:

| Event | Constant | When |
|-------|----------|------|
| `eval.completed` | `EventEvalCompleted` | Eval finished successfully (regardless of score) |
| `eval.failed` | `EventEvalFailed` | Eval handler returned an error |

The `eval.completed` event carries an `EvalCompletedData` payload with the eval ID, type, score, and derived `Passed` field (`IsPassed()` — true when score is nil or ≥ 1.0). The `eval.failed` event indicates an infrastructure error (the handler itself errored), not a low score.

:::caution
`eval.failed` means the eval **errored** — it does not mean the score was low. A working eval that returns score 0.0 emits `eval.completed`, not `eval.failed`.
:::

## Pack Eval Resolution

When both pack-level and prompt-level evals are defined, they are **merged**:

1. Prompt evals override pack evals where IDs match
2. Pack-only evals are preserved
3. Prompt-only evals are appended

This allows packs to define baseline evals while individual prompts customize or extend them.

## Example

See the [`eval-test` example](https://github.com/AltairaLabs/promptarena/tree/main/examples/eval-test) for a working Arena configuration that evaluates saved conversations with both deterministic assertions and LLM judge evals.
