## Use Cases

### 1. Quick Pack Summary

```

### 2. Find Available Prompts

```bash
packc inspect packs/app.pack.json | grep -A 5 "=== Prompts"
```

```bash
packc inspect packs/app.pack.json | grep "Version:"
```

### 4. List All Tools

```bash
packc inspect packs/app.pack.json | grep "Tools:" | sort -u
```

### 5. Compare Packs

```bash
diff <(packc inspect packs/v1.pack.json) <(packc inspect packs/v2.pack.json)
```

### 6. Document Pack Contents

```bash
# Generate documentation
packc inspect packs/prod.pack.json > docs/pack-contents.md
```

## Exit Codes

- `0` - Success
- `1` - Error (pack not found, invalid format, etc.)

## Common Errors

### Pack Not Found

```bash
$ packc inspect missing.pack.json
Error loading pack: open missing.pack.json: no such file or directory
```

**Solution:** Check file path is correct

### Invalid Pack Format

```bash
$ packc inspect invalid.json
Error loading pack: invalid pack format
```

**Solution:** Ensure file is a valid pack (use `validate` first)

## Integration Examples

### Pre-deployment Check

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check pack before deploying

echo "Inspecting pack..."
packc inspect packs/prod.pack.json

read -p "Deploy this pack? (y/n) " -n 1 -r
echo
if [[ $REPLY =~ ^[Yy]$ ]]; then
  ./deploy.sh packs/prod.pack.json
fi
```

### Pack Comparison Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Compare two pack versions

OLD_PACK=$1
NEW_PACK=$2

echo "=== Old Pack ==="
packc inspect "$OLD_PACK"

echo ""
echo "=== New Pack ==="
packc inspect "$NEW_PACK"

echo ""
echo "=== Differences ==="
diff <(packc inspect "$OLD_PACK") <(packc inspect "$NEW_PACK")
```

### Pack Inventory

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Generate inventory of all packs

echo "# Pack Inventory" > inventory.md
echo "" >> inventory.md

for pack in packs/*.pack.json; do
  echo "## $(basename $pack)" >> inventory.md
  packc inspect "$pack" | head -n 20 >> inventory.md
  echo "" >> inventory.md
done
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Inspect Before Using

Always inspect new packs:

```bash
packc inspect unknown.pack.json
```

### 2. Document Pack Contents

Keep pack documentation up-to-date:

```bash
packc inspect packs/app.pack.json > docs/PACK.md
git add docs/PACK.md
git commit -m "docs: update pack documentation"
```

### 3. Verify After Download

Inspect downloaded packs:

```bash
curl -O https://example.com/packs/app.pack.json
packc inspect app.pack.json
packc validate app.pack.json
```

### 4. Compare Environments

```bash
# Compare dev vs prod
diff <(packc inspect packs/app.dev.pack.json) \
     <(packc inspect packs/app.prod.pack.json)
```
