**Deploy prompt packs to any cloud provider using adapter plugins**

---

## What is Deploy?

Deploy is PromptKit's extensible deployment framework. It ships prompt packs to cloud providers through **adapters**—plugin binaries that translate a universal deploy workflow into provider-specific API calls.

### Why Adapters?

Cloud providers each have unique APIs, resource models, and authentication flows. Rather than building every integration into the CLI, Deploy uses a plugin architecture:

- **Provider-agnostic CLI** — Same commands for every target
- **Adapter plugins** — Small binaries that speak JSON-RPC over stdio
- **State tracking** — Checksums, timestamps, and adapter state persisted locally
- **Environment support** — Dev, staging, and production from a single config

### What Deploy Does

- **Plans** deployments before applying them (like `terraform plan`)
- **Applies** changes with streaming progress feedback
- **Tracks** deployment state with checksums and versioning
- **Destroys** resources cleanly when no longer needed
- **Manages** adapter installation and discovery

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install an adapter
promptarena deploy adapter install agentcore

# Add deploy config to arena.yaml
cat >> arena.yaml <<'EOF'
deploy:
  provider: agentcore
  config:
    region: us-west-2
EOF

# Preview what will change
promptarena deploy plan

# Deploy
promptarena deploy

# Check status
promptarena deploy status
```

## How It Works

```mermaid

  pack[".pack.json<br/>(compiled pack)"]
  cli["promptarena deploy<br/>(CLI)"]
  adapter["Adapter<br/>(JSON-RPC plugin)"]
  cloud["Cloud Provider<br/>(AWS, GCP, etc.)"]
  state[".promptarena/<br/>deploy.state"]
  pack --> cli --> adapter --> cloud
  cli --> state
```
